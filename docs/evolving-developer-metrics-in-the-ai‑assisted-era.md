# Research on Evolving Developer Metrics in the AI‑Assisted Era (2026)

## 1 Why traditional GitHub‑style metrics are losing relevance

### 1.1 Common metrics in 2024
Many GitHub dashboards and badges evaluate individual developers using activity‑based indicators such as:

- **Commits and lines of code (LOC)** – the number of commits or total lines added/removed in repositories.
- **Pull requests (PRs) created/merged and issues closed** – counts of contributions reviewed or merged into the main branch.
- **Code reviews and comments** – number of review approvals or comments given.
- **Active days and cross‑repository work** – how often someone contributes or how many repositories they impact.

These metrics align with older conceptions of “output” when software was largely hand‑written. They also match the metrics shown on the current developer badge (commits, PRs merged, code reviews, issues closed, active days, cross‑repo activity and an “impact score”) displayed by the user.

### 1.2 Why they are becoming inadequate

1. **AI generates large volumes of code:**  A LinkedIn post reacting to claims that AI can “rewrite massive C/C++ codebases in Rust” notes that “Lines of code are a meaningless metric; you can generate tens of thousands of lines in a weekend” [oai_citation:0‡linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sameergoyal_engineeringtidbits-softwareengineering-activity-7413833958200832000-U6pV#:~:text=engineer,many%20execs%20struggle%20with%3A%20Software).  The post argues that the difficult part of engineering is knowing what should exist and what must not change [oai_citation:1‡linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sameergoyal_engineeringtidbits-softwareengineering-activity-7413833958200832000-U6pV#:~:text=engineer,many%20execs%20struggle%20with%3A%20Software).  Similar sentiment appears in the Futurism analysis of 90 % AI‑generated code, which observes that 90 % of code volume may be boilerplate while the remaining human‑written 10 % handles 60 % of the complexity, and therefore “lines of code stopped being a useful metric decades ago; AI makes it completely meaningless now” [oai_citation:2‡vocal.media](https://vocal.media/futurism/90-code-ai-written-by-2026-reality-check#:~:text=tasks%2C%20not%20code%20volume,not%20so%20much).

2. **Code volume ≠ value:**  The Index.dev productivity study states that traditional indicators like **lines‑of‑code or tickets closed are easy to game and often meaningless**, providing no actionable insight [oai_citation:3‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=drafts%20only%20shorten%20delivery%20when,move%20at%20the%20same%20pace).  The study highlights that adoption of AI coding assistants is widespread yet the key challenge is improving delivery speed and quality [oai_citation:4‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=AI%20coding%20assistants%20are%20ubiquitous,more%20code%20%E2%89%A0%20more%20value).

3. **Output without context can be misleading:**  Code generated by AI must still be reviewed and integrated.  The same Index.dev study measured modern engineering performance using frameworks such as **DORA** (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Mean Time to Restore and Change Failure Rate) and **SPACE** (Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication and Efficiency).  It concludes that teams should make DORA metrics the “north star for ROI” and avoid relying on LOC, raw PR counts or commits as business KPIs [oai_citation:5‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=We%20measured%20productivity%20using%20modern,tasks%20completed%20and%20PRs%20merged).

4. **Engineering vs. code writing:**  A separate LinkedIn post emphasises that when software fails, the important question is not “Who wrote this line of code?” but “Who owned the decision?”  AI can already write APIs, UI components and even suggest architectures, making code writing cheaper while decision‑making becomes more valuable [oai_citation:6‡linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sameergoyal_engineeringtidbits-softwareengineering-activity-7413833958200832000-U6pV).  The post underscores that engineering encompasses judgment, context and accountability [oai_citation:7‡linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sameergoyal_engineeringtidbits-softwareengineering-activity-7413833958200832000-U6pV)—attributes not captured by commit counts.

5. **AI adoption does not automatically speed up developers:**  A randomized controlled study by METR found that experienced open‑source developers took **19 % longer** to complete issues when allowed to use early‑2025 AI tools [oai_citation:8‡metr.org](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/#:~:text=We%20conduct%20a%20randomized%20controlled,one%20relevant%20setting%3B%20as%20these).  Developers expected AI to make them faster by 24 %, yet the reality was slower progress [oai_citation:9‡metr.org](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/#:~:text=When%20developers%20are%20allowed%20to,sped%20them%20up%20by%2020).  This result cautions against assuming that more AI‑generated code means greater productivity.

6. **Quality and integration bottlenecks:**  The Index.dev study shows that while AI assistants increased individual throughput by ~21 %, review and QA times ballooned by ~91 % and defect counts rose [oai_citation:10‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=Our%20results%20illustrate%20the%20AI,level%20gains%20lag).  Increased code volume without corresponding improvements in review and testing leads to quality trade‑offs.

In summary, the traditional activity‑based metrics focus on quantity of code rather than the complexity of problems solved, quality of solutions, system design decisions and team impact.  They overlook the additional coordination, validation and creative thinking required when AI generates large portions of the codebase.

## 2 Current sentiment on AI‑assisted development

### 2.1 Widespread adoption but growing skepticism

- According to a 2025 survey cited by Crossbridge Global Partners, **84 % of developers use or plan to use AI tools**, yet only **60 % have a favourable sentiment**, down from 77 % in 2023 [oai_citation:11‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=Quick%C2%A0Answer).  AI adoption is rising while trust is falling.
- The same article reports that AI writes **46 % of all code** in 2025 (up from 27 % in 2023) [oai_citation:12‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=How%C2%A0are%20AI%C2%A0tools%C2%A0changing%C2%A0what%C2%A0skills%C2%A0developers%C2%A0need%3F%20AI%C2%A0tools%C2%A0now%C2%A0write%C2%A046,that%20savvy%20developers%20can%20exploit).  However, many developers worry about the quality of AI suggestions and still prefer to validate everything manually [oai_citation:13‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=The%C2%A0Trust%20Gap%3A%C2%A0Your%C2%A0Competitive%C2%A0Advantage).
- Faros AI’s “productivity paradox” report (referenced by Index.dev) notes that developers complete twice as many code changes, yet company‑level performance remains flat [oai_citation:14‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=AI%20coding%20assistants%20are%20ubiquitous,more%20code%20%E2%89%A0%20more%20value).
- The Futurism article suggests that hitting 90 % AI‑generated code by 2026 may hide the fact that human‑written code continues to handle most complexity and value delivery; it also raises questions about IP ownership and the need for new team roles such as **prompt engineers**, **AI integration specialists**, **code architects** and **quality validators** [oai_citation:15‡vocal.media](https://vocal.media/futurism/90-code-ai-written-by-2026-reality-check#:~:text=tasks%2C%20not%20code%20volume,not%20so%20much).

### 2.2 Skills that are gaining importance

Research and industry commentary highlight a shift from syntax and boilerplate coding to higher‑order skills:

1. **Prompt engineering and AI interaction:**  Developers with high AI usage (75–100 % usage quartile) achieve acceptance rates of ~29.7 % while light users only see 11 % [oai_citation:16‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=Skills%C2%A0Becoming%C2%A0More%C2%A0Valuable).  Writing clear, context‑rich prompts, iterating on AI output and understanding when to be specific versus creative are becoming core competencies [oai_citation:17‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=Skills%C2%A0Becoming%C2%A0More%C2%A0Valuable).

2. **Architectural & system design thinking:**  AI excels at generating tactical code but struggles with strategic architecture.  Companies need engineers who can design systems, understand trade‑offs and decompose problems into AI‑solvable chunks [oai_citation:18‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=).

3. **Code review & quality assurance:**  AI‑assisted code tends to increase duplicate patterns and churn.  Developers who can identify AI-generated anti‑patterns, spot security vulnerabilities and correct hallucinated implementations are in demand [oai_citation:19‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=).

4. **AI‑assisted debugging & problem diagnosis:**  Debugging shifts from finding syntax errors to understanding why AI made certain choices.  Skills such as reverse‑engineering AI code, identifying subtle logic errors and combining traditional debugging with AI analysis are increasingly valuable [oai_citation:20‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=%23%204.%20AI).

5. **Domain knowledge & business context:**  AI cannot understand a business’s unique requirements.  Developers who bridge technical execution and business goals—translating customer pain points into AI‑friendly specifications and making judgment calls—become indispensable [oai_citation:21‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=).

These emerging skills emphasise judgement, communication and context—qualities not measured by commit counts.

## 3 Modern frameworks and emerging metrics

### 3.1 DORA and SPACE metrics

The **DORA** metrics provide a widely adopted set of delivery and stability indicators:

- **Deployment frequency:** how often code is released.
- **Lead time for changes:** time from commit to production.
- **Change failure rate:** percentage of deployments causing incidents.
- **Mean time to restore (MTTR):** time required to restore service after a failure.

The Index.dev study recommends making DORA metrics the “north star” for return on investment and cautions against using raw LOC or PR counts as business KPIs [oai_citation:22‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=We%20measured%20productivity%20using%20modern,tasks%20completed%20and%20PRs%20merged).

The **SPACE** framework adds developer‑centric signals: satisfaction, performance, activity, communication and efficiency.  Index.dev used surveys and telemetry to measure satisfaction and flow, along with activity metrics such as PR count and cycle time [oai_citation:23‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=We%20measured%20productivity%20using%20modern,tasks%20completed%20and%20PRs%20merged).

### 3.2 Metrics designed for AI‑assisted workflows

1. **TrueThroughput:**  GetDX introduces *TrueThroughput*, which adjusts throughput by taking into account the complexity of pull requests using AI.  It allows leaders to compare AI users and non‑users and track how AI impacts delivery [oai_citation:24‡getdx.com](https://getdx.com/blog/5-metrics-in-dx-to-measure-ai-impact/#:~:text=TrueThroughput).

2. **Pull Request Cycle Time:**  Measuring the time from PR creation to merge helps determine whether AI tools are accelerating or slowing teams [oai_citation:25‡getdx.com](https://getdx.com/blog/5-metrics-in-dx-to-measure-ai-impact/#:~:text=Pull%20Request%20Cycle%20Time).

3. **PR Revert Rate:**  This metric counts how often PRs are reverted, signalling the effect of AI on quality and highlighting rework introduced by AI tools [oai_citation:26‡getdx.com](https://getdx.com/blog/5-metrics-in-dx-to-measure-ai-impact/#:~:text=PR%20Revert%20Rate).

4. **Developer Experience Index (DXI):**  A composite score covering test coverage, change confidence and other factors linked to financial impact [oai_citation:27‡getdx.com](https://getdx.com/blog/5-metrics-in-dx-to-measure-ai-impact/#:~:text=Developer%20Experience%20Index%20).  DXI correlates with time saved; each one‑point increase saves ~13 minutes per developer per week [oai_citation:28‡getdx.com](https://getdx.com/blog/5-metrics-in-dx-to-measure-ai-impact/#:~:text=Developer%20Experience%20Index%20).

5. **Percentage of Time Spent on New Feature Development:**  Measures whether AI is freeing developers from bug‑fixing and maintenance to focus on new capabilities [oai_citation:29‡getdx.com](https://getdx.com/blog/5-metrics-in-dx-to-measure-ai-impact/#:~:text=Percentage%20of%20Time%20Spent%20on,New%20Feature%20Development).

6. **AI suggestion acceptance rate:**  The Crossbridge article suggests tracking the percentage of AI suggestions accepted by developers; higher acceptance often correlates with better prompt quality and productivity, while extremely high acceptance may indicate inadequate review [oai_citation:30‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=Skills%C2%A0Becoming%C2%A0More%C2%A0Valuable).

7. **AI usage telemetry:**  Tools such as Copilot dashboards show how often AI is invoked and the types of tasks it assists.  Combining AI usage data with throughput and quality metrics helps identify whether developers leverage AI effectively or rely on it blindly.

8. **Quality metrics:**  Traditional quality metrics—defect density, test coverage, change failure rate—remain relevant.  The Graph AI article emphasises code quality, code churn, lead time, technical debt and review time [oai_citation:31‡graphapp.ai](https://www.graphapp.ai/blog/top-developer-performance-metrics-to-track-in-2025#:~:text=Key%20Developer%20Performance%20Metrics%20for,and%20Impact%20on%20Software%20Teams).  These should be measured alongside AI‑specific metrics to ensure speed gains do not degrade quality.

## 4 Implications for the developer badge

### 4.1 Shortcomings of the current badge

The user’s current badge calculates an “impact score” using GitHub activity metrics (commits, PRs merged, code reviews, issues closed, active days and cross‑repo contributions).  This aligns with the traditional, output‑oriented view of development.  However:

- **Volume metrics can be gamed**: AI can generate large amounts of code, making commit counts or lines of code meaningless [oai_citation:32‡linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sameergoyal_engineeringtidbits-softwareengineering-activity-7413833958200832000-U6pV#:~:text=engineer,many%20execs%20struggle%20with%3A%20Software).
- **Activity metrics ignore context**: They do not distinguish between trivial boilerplate and complex architectural decisions [oai_citation:33‡vocal.media](https://vocal.media/futurism/90-code-ai-written-by-2026-reality-check#:~:text=tasks%2C%20not%20code%20volume,not%20so%20much).
- **Quality and outcome metrics are missing**: There is no measure of deployment success, defect rates or the stability of delivered software.
- **AI utilisation is invisible**: Current metrics do not show how effectively a developer uses AI tools or contributes to prompt libraries and design documentation.

A badge based on such metrics risks signalling outdated notions of productivity, undermining its relevance in 2026.

### 4.2 Proposed categories for new metrics

Based on the research above, a modern developer impact badge should incorporate a balanced set of metrics across **speed**, **quality**, **effectiveness** and **AI proficiency**.  Possible categories include:

| Category | Example metrics (adapt and weight appropriately) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Delivery & stability (DORA)** | Deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, mean time to restore | Captures how efficiently and reliably developers deliver value.  Focuses on outcomes rather than code volume [oai_citation:34‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=We%20measured%20productivity%20using%20modern,tasks%20completed%20and%20PRs%20merged). |
| **Quality & rework** | PR revert rate [oai_citation:35‡getdx.com](https://getdx.com/blog/5-metrics-in-dx-to-measure-ai-impact/#:~:text=PR%20Revert%20Rate), defect density, test coverage, code churn [oai_citation:36‡graphapp.ai](https://www.graphapp.ai/blog/top-developer-performance-metrics-to-track-in-2025#:~:text=Key%20Developer%20Performance%20Metrics%20for,and%20Impact%20on%20Software%20Teams) | Ensures faster throughput doesn’t compromise quality; measures maintainability and technical debt. |
| **AI usage & prompt proficiency** | AI suggestion acceptance rate [oai_citation:37‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=Skills%C2%A0Becoming%C2%A0More%C2%A0Valuable), number of prompts crafted/improved, contributions to shared prompt libraries, ratio of AI‑generated lines accepted vs. rejected, time saved per task | Indicates how effectively a developer uses AI tools; emphasises skill in prompt engineering rather than blindly accepting output. |
| **System design & decision‑making** | Number of architecture documents authored/reviewed, design reviews participated in, decision records captured, complexity of tasks decomposed | Recognises higher‑order work (problem framing, trade‑offs) highlighted by engineering leaders [oai_citation:38‡linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sameergoyal_engineeringtidbits-softwareengineering-activity-7413833958200832000-U6pV) and Crossbridge’s emphasis on system design [oai_citation:39‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=). |
| **Code review & quality assurance** | Number and quality of code review comments identifying AI‑generated issues, security vulnerabilities spotted, percentage of reviews that lead to substantive improvements | Reflects the critical role of reviewing AI‑generated code and ensuring robustness [oai_citation:40‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=). |
| **Debugging & incident response** | Mean time to resolve AI‑related bugs, number of incidents resolved or prevented, ability to diagnose AI hallucinations [oai_citation:41‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=%23%204.%20AI) | Measures the often‑ignored cost of AI errors and the expertise required to debug them. |
| **Collaboration & knowledge sharing** | Contributions to documentation, mentoring sessions, internal talks, prompt‑engineering workshops, cross‑repo mentoring | Encourages sharing AI practices and improving team productivity and trust. |
| **Domain & business impact** | Features delivered that align with business outcomes, customer feedback scores, involvement in translating business needs into technical solutions [oai_citation:42‡gocrossbridge.com](https://gocrossbridge.com/blog/skills-companies-need-in-2026/#:~:text=) | Recognises contextual understanding and ability to deliver real value beyond code. |
| **Developer satisfaction & wellbeing** | Surveys on flow and satisfaction (SPACE), self‑reported confidence in AI tools, participation in training | Ensures metrics do not incentivise burnout; monitors whether AI tools enhance or hinder developer experience [oai_citation:43‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=We%20measured%20productivity%20using%20modern,tasks%20completed%20and%20PRs%20merged). |

### 4.3 Guidelines for designing the new badge

1. **Balance speed and quality**: Combine throughput indicators (TrueThroughput, PR cycle time) with quality measures (PR revert rate, defect density) to ensure fast delivery does not sacrifice reliability.

2. **Incorporate AI‑specific signals**: Track AI usage, suggestion acceptance rate and prompt quality.  Provide guidance and training for prompt engineering; highlight developers who build shared prompt libraries or refine prompts for others.

3. **Value design and decision work**: Recognise contributions to architecture, system design, decision records and risk mitigation.  Use peer review to validate the significance of design decisions.

4. **Include collaborative and cross‑functional activities**: Evaluate how developers mentor others, write documentation, participate in design reviews and help integrate AI tools across teams.

5. **Avoid single aggregate scores**: Instead of a single impact score, offer a composite badge with multiple facets (e.g., Delivery, Quality, AI Proficiency, Design & Leadership, Collaboration).  This prevents oversimplification and gamification.

6. **Use transparent weighting and normalisation**: Document how each metric is calculated, normalise across repository sizes and account for project complexity.  Encourage developers to understand and critique the metrics.

7. **Continuously iterate**: As AI tools and practices evolve, regularly review and adjust metrics based on developer feedback and new research.  The 2025 Index.dev study warns against static metrics and stresses the need to pair AI adoption with process changes to realise ROI [oai_citation:44‡index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity#:~:text=Our%20results%20illustrate%20the%20AI,level%20gains%20lag).

## 5 Conclusion

Traditional GitHub metrics such as commits, lines of code and raw PR counts measure activity rather than impact.  With AI capable of generating large volumes of boilerplate code, these metrics become misleading and may encourage quantity over quality.  Modern research emphasises that engineering value lies in problem framing, system design, quality assurance, and the ability to use AI tools effectively and responsibly.  Adopting frameworks like DORA, SPACE and emerging AI‑specific metrics (TrueThroughput, PR revert rate, AI acceptance rate) provides a more accurate picture of developer impact.  Additionally, the skills most valued in 2026—prompt engineering, architectural thinking, rigorous code review, AI‑assisted debugging, domain knowledge and judgement—should inform the metrics used to recognise and reward developers.

A forward‑looking badge should therefore move away from simple activity counts and towards a multi‑dimensional evaluation that captures delivery efficiency, quality, AI proficiency, design and collaborative impact.  Such a badge would remain relevant in a world where LLMs write most of the code and human developers focus on guiding, refining and integrating AI‑generated solutions.

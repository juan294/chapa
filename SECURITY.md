# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Chapa, please report it responsibly. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.**

### Preferred method

Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/juan294/chapa/security/advisories/new) to submit a report directly through the repository. This keeps the details confidential until a fix is available.

### Alternative contact

Email: **support@chapa.thecreativetoken.com**

Include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

## Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: within 5 business days
- **Fix or mitigation**: as soon as practical, typically within 30 days

## Scope

This policy covers the Chapa web application, API endpoints, badge rendering pipeline, and the `chapa-cli` npm package.

Out of scope:
- Third-party services (GitHub, Vercel, Upstash, PostHog)
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service attacks

## Supported versions

## Recognition

NOTICES — License Exceptions
=============================

Chapa's approved dependency licenses are: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC.

The following dependencies use licenses outside that approved list. Each has
been reviewed and accepted for the reasons documented below.


PRODUCTION DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------

### @img/sharp-libvips-darwin-arm64
License: LGPL-3.0-or-later
Purpose: Native image processing library (libvips), used by `sharp` for
         image resizing and format conversion.
Rationale: libvips is a pre-built native binary that is dynamically linked
           at runtime — it is NOT compiled into or statically linked with
           the project's JavaScript/TypeScript code. LGPL-3.0 permits
           dynamic linking without requiring the consuming project to adopt
           the LGPL. No modifications are made to the library. This is
           consistent with standard Node.js usage of sharp/libvips.

### @resvg/resvg-js / @resvg/resvg-js-darwin-arm64
License: MPL-2.0
Purpose: High-fidelity SVG-to-PNG rendering used for OG image and badge
         PNG generation.
Rationale: MPL-2.0 is a file-level copyleft license. It only requires
           source disclosure for modifications to MPL-licensed files
           themselves. Chapa uses these packages as unmodified dependencies
           — no MPL-licensed source files are changed. The project's own
           source code is not affected by the MPL.

### @vercel/analytics
License: MPL-2.0
Purpose: Vercel Web Analytics integration for page-view tracking.
Rationale: Same as @resvg/resvg-js above — used as an unmodified
           dependency. MPL-2.0 file-level copyleft does not extend to
           the consuming project's code.


DEVELOPMENT-ONLY DEPENDENCIES
------------------------------

These packages are used only during development and testing. They are never
included in the production bundle or deployed to end users.

### axe-core
License: MPL-2.0
Purpose: Accessibility testing engine used in automated tests.
Rationale: Dev-only dependency, not shipped to production. MPL-2.0
           file-level copyleft does not apply to the project's own code,
           and the package is used unmodified.

### lightningcss
License: MPL-2.0
Purpose: CSS parsing, transformation, and minification used by the build
         toolchain.
Rationale: Dev-only build tool dependency, not shipped to production.
           MPL-2.0 file-level copyleft does not apply to the project's
           own code, and the package is used unmodified.

### lightningcss-darwin-arm64
License: MPL-2.0
Purpose: Platform-specific native binary for lightningcss (macOS ARM64).
Rationale: Dev-only build tool dependency, not shipped to production.
           Same rationale as lightningcss above — used unmodified, MPL-2.0
           file-level copyleft does not apply to the project's own code.
